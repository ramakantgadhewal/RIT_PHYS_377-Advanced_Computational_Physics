    Write a program, or modify an earlier program, to calculate the temperature
    profile of the crust as a function of depth up to 20 m and time up to 10 years.
    Start with temperature everywhere equal to 10Â°C, except at the surface and the
    deepest point, choose values for the number of grid points and the time-step h,
    then run your program for the first nine simulated years, to allow it to settle
    down into whatever pattern it reaches. Then for the tenth and final year plot
    four temperature profiles taken at 3-month intervals on a single graph to
    illustrate how the temperature changes as a function of depth and time.
